        <p>Object in Js are quite like objects in real life,they have properties and things they can do, e.g A car(object) could have properties like, model, color, type and then its methods would be things like driving, reversimg etc. A couple of built in objects inside of javascript may include: <li>An array of items</li><li>Window object</li></p>
